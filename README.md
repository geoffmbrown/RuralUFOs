### The truth is out where?: Rurality and heterotopia in two decades of UFO sighting narratives

Using webscraped data from a public repository of UFO sighting reports, NUFORC.org, this project seeks to explore the role rurality plays in witness submitted UFO sighting narratives.

This repository stores all code snippets and scripts used during the analysis of the UFO sighting data.

Currently the data cleaning process is being documented in the /DataClean.md file.
